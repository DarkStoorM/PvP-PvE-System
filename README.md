# PvP/PvE System for PHP

No description needed, the code is commented.

But just in case:
The script is based not on player turns like P1 -> P2 -> P1 [...].
Player turns are based on character attack speed. More info in the code.

You can remove optional Echos from the code. It was only for "debug" purposes.

I called it PvP/PvE from obvious reasons. You can use it also vs monsters.
